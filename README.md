Description: Basically just a matrix calculator, where the user can input their own matrix and it does it for you with all the calucations. 
Mistakes: Mind that this is still in beta and will likely be in beta still due to being lazy on workin on it.
Mistake 1: Making it stop on round numbers instead of decimals due to most professors that do teach it want the answer in full numbers.
